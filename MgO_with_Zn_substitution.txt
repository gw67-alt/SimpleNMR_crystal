Zincite-Doped Magnesium Oxide (MgO with Zn substitution)
Magnesium oxide with zinc substitution (Mg₁₋ₓZnₓO) is a simple non-toxic periodic crystal system that demonstrates isomorphism. This is very straightforward to create through standard solid-state synthesis methods.

Simple Synthesis Method
Mix magnesium oxide (MgO) and zinc oxide (ZnO) powders in desired proportions
Heat at 1000-1200°C for several hours
Cool slowly to room temperature
Crystal Structure
Crystal system: Cubic (rock salt structure)
Space group: Fm3̄m
Each metal cation is coordinated by six oxygen anions in an octahedral arrangement
Lattice parameter: ~4.2Å (varies slightly with Zn content)
NMR Effects and Signatures
²⁵Mg NMR
Chemical shift: ~0 ppm (relative to MgCl₂)
Relatively sharp peak for pure MgO
Progressive broadening with increasing Zn substitution
Distribution of chemical shifts reflects the number of Zn neighbors (0 to 6)
⁶⁷Zn NMR
Chemical shift: ~200-300 ppm
Quadrupolar coupling: Moderate due to local distortion of the cubic symmetry
Signal intensity proportional to Zn content
Provides direct evidence of Zn incorporation into the MgO lattice
¹⁷O NMR (requires enrichment)
Chemical shift: ~30-50 ppm
Shows distribution reflecting different Mg/Zn neighboring environments
The peak position shifts slightly depending on the ratio of Mg
neighbors
Line broadening increases with Zn content due to increased disorder
The beauty of this system is its simplicity - the cubic structure makes it easy to interpret NMR data, while the isomorphic replacement of Mg²⁺ with Zn²⁺ creates subtle but measurable changes in the local electronic environment that can be clearly detected through NMR spectroscopy.
